    <p class="h4h">Energy In the UAE</p>

    <p class="para">
      The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has the world's sixth largest proven oil
      reserves and the fifth largest natural gas reserves, making the country a
      critical partner and responsible supplier in global energy markets. The
      UAE is the world's third largest exporter of crude oil, though exports
      very little the United States. While a mainstay to the economy, oil
      exports actually account for only about one-third of economic activity, as
      a result of aggressive government policies designed to diversify the UAE
      economy. The UAE is also pursuing groundbreaking renewable energy and
      energy efficiency programs. In 2005 the UAE ratified the Kyoto Protocol to
      the U Convention on Climate Change, becoming one of the furst major
      Oil-producing countries to do so. Abu Dhabi has also established one of
      the world's most comprehensive clean energy initiatives.

    <p class="h4h">Oil and Natural Gas</p>

    <p class="para">
      Each emirate controls its own oil production and resource development. Abu
      Dhabi holds 94 percent of the UAE' soil resources, or about 92.2 billion
      barrels. Dubai contains an estimated 4 billion barrels, followed by
      Sharjah and Ras al-Khaimah with 1.5 billion and 100 million barrels of
      oil, respectively.
    </p>

    <p class="h4h">Expanding oil supply</p>

    <p class="para">
      The UAE continues to significantly increase its production to supply the
      global energy markets. While some OPEC nations and many non-OPEC nations
      have seen production declines over the last five years, the UAE has
      increased its total production of crude oil by approximately 31 percent.
      In no year during that period has average annual production fallen below
      the previous year.

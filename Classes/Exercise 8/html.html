    <h1>Importance of Recycling</h1>
    <hr width="500px" size="12px" color="red" align="center" />
    <p align="justify">When we recycle, used materials are converted into new products, reducing the need to consume
        natural resources. If used materials are not recycled, new products are made by extracting fresh,
        raw material from the Earth, through mining and forestry. Recycling helps conserve important raw
        materials and protects natural habitats for the future.
        Using recycled materials in the manufacturing process uses considerably less energy than that
        required for producing new products from raw materials - even when comparing all associated
        costs including transport etc. Plus there are extra energy eavings because more energy is required
        to extract, refine, transport and procex raw materials ready for industry compared with providing
        industry-ready materials.
        Recycling reduces the need for extracting (mining, quarrying and logging), refining and processing
        raw materials all of which create substantial air and water pollution. As recycling saves energy it
        also reduces greenhouse gas emissions, which helps to tackle climate change. Current UK
        recycling is estimated to save more than 18 million tgnnes of 002 a year - the equivalent to taking
        5 million cars off the road.</p>
